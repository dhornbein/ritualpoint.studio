# Ritual Point Studio - AI Specification Index

This directory contains the AI specification and documentation for the Ritual Point Studio project.

## File Overview

### Core Specification Files

- **`spec.md`** - Main project specification including architecture, objectives, and development guidelines
- **`instructions.md`** - AI-specific instructions for development assistance and code patterns
- **`features.md`** - Detailed feature list with priorities, requirements, and implementation plans
- **`testing.md`** - Comprehensive testing strategy and best practices

## Quick Reference

### Project Context
**Technology:** Nuxt 3, Vue.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Purpose:** Mystical art & divination website (tarot readings, tattoo art, Dark Moon Tarot deck)  
**Owner:** Drew H / Ritual Point Studio  

### Current Priorities
1. **Testing Infrastructure** (Critical)
2. **Tattoo Gallery** (Critical - ASAP)
3. **Navigation Enhancement** (High)
4. **Reading Promotion** (High)

### Key Patterns
- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Tailwind-first styling with custom SCSS
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Testing-first development approach

## How to Use These Files

### For AI Assistants
1. Start with `instructions.md` for context and guidelines
2. Reference `spec.md` for architectural decisions
3. Check `features.md` for current priorities and requirements
4. Use `testing.md` for quality standards and testing approaches

### For Developers
1. Review `spec.md` for project overview and technical architecture
2. Follow patterns outlined in `instructions.md`
3. Prioritize work based on `features.md`
4. Implement testing as specified in `testing.md`

### For Project Management
1. Track progress using `features.md` task lists
2. Reference `spec.md` for technical constraints and capabilities
3. Use quality gates defined in `testing.md`

## Updating These Files

### When to Update
- **New Features:** Add to `features.md` with proper priority and requirements
- **Architecture Changes:** Update `spec.md` and corresponding instructions
- **Process Changes:** Modify `instructions.md` and `testing.md` as needed
- **Completed Work:** Mark tasks as done in `features.md`

### Update Process
1. Make changes to relevant specification files
2. Ensure consistency across all files
3. Test any new patterns or guidelines
4. Communicate changes to team/AI assistants
